## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- This is my first time using Android Studio, so due to lack of experience there was some things that happened I didn't know how to deal with. 
  e.g. My emulator black-screened at one point (near the end) and I didn't understand what was happening or how to fix it. Ended up deleting the whole thing and uninstalling/reinstalling Android Studio. Later on I think it may have been that the virtual device powered off somehow maybe? (I didn't click the power button so I don't know how, but I never even noticed there was a power button till much later on).
- Another issue was that my emulator kept crashing at one point, and then after restarting it just wouldn't launch - crashed immediately upon run. I had to dig around on Google and Youtube to get past this one which involved uninstalling the ROM and reinstalling/creating a new virtual device.
- General unfamiliarity with android code, libraries, syntax, builtin methods, etc. made things take long to understand and/or do. The help features seem decently ok though.
- Didn't have enough time before deadline to try and learn + implement how to improve app functionality
